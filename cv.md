### About Me

I work as a _layout designer_ in a publishing house. And I already have a really great experience in this field. My colleagues speak of me as a responsible employee who can be entrusted with the most urgent project.
But now I'm focused on front-end development. I have already completed the course once and received a diploma. Unfortunately, I didn't change my job. But now... **_I'll take this chance!_**

  }
}
